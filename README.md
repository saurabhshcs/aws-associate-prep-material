## AWS IAM Service & CLI
> Amazon Web Services (AWS) provides Identity and Access Management (IAM) to help manage access to AWS resources. IAM allows for the creation and management of users, groups, and roles, which are used to define permissions and access to AWS resources.

<details><summary> IAM User</summary>
<p>IAM User
An IAM user is an entity within an AWS account that has specific permissions to access AWS resources. An IAM user can be an individual, a service, or an application that requires access to resources within an AWS account. Each IAM user has a unique set of credentials that consist of an access key and a secret access key. IAM users can be granted permissions to access specific resources or services within an AWS account.</p>
</details>

<details><summary> IAM User Group</summary>
<p>
An IAM user group is a collection of IAM users that have similar permissions and access requirements. User groups simplify access management and reduce the administrative overhead required to grant permissions to individual IAM users. Users can be added or removed from a user group, and the permissions associated with the user group will apply to all users within that group.</p>
